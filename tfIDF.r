#normalizes expression matrix with TF-IDF and filters based on threshold


#first argument is file name of input matrix 
#second argument is file name of normalized by output matrix
#normalizaton is done by term frequency inverse document frequency alg, used by Cusanovich et al 2017
	#demphsizes signals which are very common
#rows are genes or peak sites, columns are cells, should have names in input matrix

#then filteres cells based on low accesible sites and filters sites based on their accesablity across cells
#filtering cells based on low accesible sites would have been done already based on outlined pipeline but if alternative pipeline used option to filter is here
#can not do by returning normTbl instead of filterNormTbl
