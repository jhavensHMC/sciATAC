#dependancy of Snakemake.count
#normalizes expression matrix with TF-IDF


#first argument is file name of input matrix 
#second argument is file name of normalized by output matrix
#normalizaton is done by term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency alg, used by Cusanovich et al 2017
	#demphsizes signals which are overlly common
#rows are genes or peak sites, columns are cells, should have names in input matrix
